Given millions of files process them sequentially in multiple stages and make sure it has good scalabilty, error handling, 
elegantly handles changes to the system. etc.

Two colors are given(yellow, blue), we have to color such that no consecutive blue color is painted


How class is loading in JVM:- Discussed about eden, perm space. using graph and BSF & DFS


You are given a linked list.
for i=1 to n/2, subtract (n-i)th number from ith number. Print modified linked list in the end.


Given three numbers A, B and M. Calculate (A*B)%M. All numbers are in a range of 1 to 10^15 so prevent overflow. 
First I gave brute force approach for running a loop A times, each time adding B to the answer and taking the mod. 
Then, I improved from O(n) to O(logn) by calculating A*B/2 recursively and multiplying it by 2. 


You are given an array of contacts. Each contact consists 3 strings: name, email and phone number. 
If any of these parameters match with any other contact’s parameter then these 2 contacts are same.


 A chess problem. I am given initial positions of 8 pawns and a knight. 
 You have to answer whether I can remove all 8 pawns using my knight

 There is a given data with time and number of orders at that time and it will random. 
 Then there will be a query of how many orders placed between a given interval of time.


 There given a list of strings out which we have to print the unique strings. 
 Unique string is a string which is not repeated.

 We are receiving a stream of data from a social network, how will you display k max persons based on number of friends

 Find level with maximum nodes on binary tree

 Addition of infinite size of integer

Given an array of string and array of characters find the string with atleast one and the most occurence of all 
characters in array of characters.If there is tie print first occuring string.
eg:vector<string> = {“abcda”, “aaaaaaa”, “abcc”}           vector<char> = {‘a’, ‘b, ‘c’};

Given n points in 2 d space and two functions JOIN(A,B) and istransitvelyconnected(A,B).
Join assigns A,B to same set while istransitvelyconnected(A,B) checks wether belong to same set.
Solved using disjoint set using path compression

 Given an infinite string defined by function f(x)=x+”0″+f(complement x) find k’th bit


 A music player has N songs , you have a random number generator rand(n) which generates a 
 number from [0,n-1] .Your task is to play a random song from given N songs such that each 
 song is played once and your program should terminate once you have played all the songs.


 A person has to cross a road and with each step he either gains some energy or loses some 
 (this info is provided as an array) . Find out the min amount of energy he should start with so 
  at any level his energy is not less than 1 ).
Simple question done in O(n).

How to solve (a*b)%m , where all a,b,m are of the order 10^15. Modulo’s distributive property is one thing .
1st approach suggested was breaking the no’s to binary as solving 
for eg:- [ ( 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^0) * (2^5) ] % [(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0)] is feasible, but he wanted faster approach.


Given three arrays. Find all the pair from the two array such that the sum of those element is in the third array

There is a file in secondary storage consisting name, address, phone and many other details. 
Now sort that file on the basis of phone no. Constraints: I have very low memory. 
I can’t bring all the content of file to main memory. Using indexing I have to solve that problem. 
I gave k-way merging approach. Now asked me to do in a different way. He gave me hint for bst.


 Given a BST which consists of marks of students in a class. It is found that all even ranked students 
 have cheated,so we reduce k marks from their score. Modify the BST to make the change of marks 
 without considering that after this operation, the BST might not remain a BST anymore.
I gave him a modified inorder traversal so that elements are sorted and solved it using a counter variable. 
He asked me to modify it to using neither a static counter variable nor a pointer passed to the recursive calls. 
For both questions, he also asked me the time and space complexity.

 Maintain the First Non-Repeating character in a stream of incoming and out going characters or digits simply in O(1).
Gave some solutions for O(n) at a particular instant of time.
But used a Hash and Queue but that did not allow maintaining the first non-repeating character as the elements could not be accessed randomly.
There were a lot of hints and finally i understood that the interviewer was hinting at a deque where the hash value is the node pointer in deque.


Given array of elements denoting price of some objects, print the maximum sum that can be obtained following some constraints-
i)only one of the two ends from the array can be selected at a time
ii)the seller can sell only one item per day
iii)the value of each of the elements gets multiplies by the number of days passed.
I did it with dynamic programming.


Given four types of array
 a)Increasing(1,2,3,4)
 b)Decreasing(4,3,2,1)
 c)Increasing-decreasing(1,2,3,4,7,6,5)
 d)Decreasing-increasing(7,6,5,1,2,3,4) 
Find the type of array in O(1) and then find the maximum element in the array.
Except case c, max element is O(1). For c, I gave binary search solution. 
he asked me to write the code considering the corner cases.


Given a series of operations to build a project along with the time taken by each operation. 
Some operations are dependent on previous operations. 
Find the minimum number of days needed to finish the operation.


Given a string, check whether string is Good or Bad(Condition – String is composed of ‘a’ and ‘b’ 
characters only and you can add only “ab” anywhere in the string to form a Good string).
