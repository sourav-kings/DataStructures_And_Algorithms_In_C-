elegantly handles changes to the system. etc.

How class is loading in JVM:- Discussed about eden, perm space. using graph and BSF & DFS


You are given a linked list.
for i=1 to n/2, subtract (n-i)th number from ith number. Print modified linked list in the end.


Given three numbers A, B and M. Calculate (A*B)%M. All numbers are in a range of 1 to 10^15 so prevent overflow. 
First I gave brute force approach for running a loop A times, each time adding B to the answer and taking the mod. 
Then, I improved from O(n) to O(logn) by calculating A*B/2 recursively and multiplying it by 2. 


You are given an array of contacts. Each contact consists 3 strings: name, email and phone number. 
If any of these parameters match with any other contact’s parameter then these 2 contacts are same.


 A chess problem. I am given initial positions of 8 pawns and a knight. 
 You have to answer whether I can remove all 8 pawns using my knight

 There is a given data with time and number of orders at that time and it will random. 
 Then there will be a query of how many orders placed between a given interval of time.


 There given a list of strings out which we have to print the unique strings. 
 Unique string is a string which is not repeated.

 We are receiving a stream of data from a social network, how will you display k max persons based on number of friends

 Find level with maximum nodes on binary tree

 Addition of infinite size of integer

Given an array of string and array of characters find the string with atleast one and the most occurence of all 
characters in array of characters.If there is tie print first occuring string.
eg:vector<string> = {“abcda”, “aaaaaaa”, “abcc”}           vector<char> = {‘a’, ‘b, ‘c’};

Given n points in 2 d space and two functions JOIN(A,B) and istransitvelyconnected(A,B).
Join assigns A,B to same set while istransitvelyconnected(A,B) checks wether belong to same set.
Solved using disjoint set using path compression

 Given an infinite string defined by function f(x)=x+”0″+f(complement x) find k’th bit


 A music player has N songs , you have a random number generator rand(n) which generates a 
 number from [0,n-1] .Your task is to play a random song from given N songs such that each 
 song is played once and your program should terminate once you have played all the songs.


 A person has to cross a road and with each step he either gains some energy or loses some 
 (this info is provided as an array) . Find out the min amount of energy he should start with so 
  at any level his energy is not less than 1 ).
Simple question done in O(n).

How to solve (a*b)%m , where all a,b,m are of the order 10^15. Modulo’s distributive property is one thing .
1st approach suggested was breaking the no’s to binary as solving 
for eg:- [ ( 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^0) * (2^5) ] % [(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0)] is feasible, but he wanted faster approach.
