Given three numbers A, B and M. Calculate (A*B)%M. All numbers are in a range of 1 to 10^15 so prevent overflow. 
First I gave brute force approach for running a loop A times, each time adding B to the answer and taking the mod. 
Then, I improved from O(n) to O(logn) by calculating A*B/2 recursively and multiplying it by 2. 


You are given an array of contacts. Each contact consists 3 strings: name, email and phone number. 
If any of these parameters match with any other contact’s parameter then these 2 contacts are same.
