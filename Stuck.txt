Given three numbers A, B and M. Calculate (A*B)%M. All numbers are in a range of 1 to 10^15 so prevent overflow. 
First I gave brute force approach for running a loop A times, each time adding B to the answer and taking the mod. 
Then, I improved from O(n) to O(logn) by calculating A*B/2 recursively and multiplying it by 2.
